      "During this placement, I contributed to the development of a modern web application built with Next.js and TypeScript. I resolved a complex dark mode bug by analysing theme toggler behaviour across user preferences, correcting CSS overrides, and refining state management to restore dynamic theme switching. I also developed a responsive, reusable, and accessible social media UI component from detailed design specifications, integrating live GraphQL data and ensuring it could be efficiently repurposed across related features. Throughout the process, I applied CSS BEM conventions and solid project organisation practices to deliver clean, production-quality code, strengthening my technical expertise and attention to detail.",
